The Linux kernel is a fancy piece of software that interacts with the physical hardware of the machine. The Linux kernel by itself is not a full [[operating system]] as many users would expect. Additional functionality e.g. a [[desktop environment]], [[sound management|sound]], or a [[bootloader]] can be found in a fully managed Linux distribution. 

## Distributions of Linux

Different maintainers package and update complete operating systems all built upon the Linux kernel but with their own desktop environments, graphical nuances, [[package managers|Aptitude]] and/or system control schemes. Some major Linux distributions are:

**Name (Upstream)**
* Debian
* Ubuntu (Debian)
* Linux Mint (Ubuntu)
* Arch Linux
* Manjaro (Arch Linux)
* Fedora
* CentOS (Fedora)
* Deepin (Debian)
* Xubuntu (Ubuntu)
