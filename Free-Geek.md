Free Geek is the name of more than a few non profit organizations that deal with [[e-waste]] recycling and community involvement in digital empowerment through open software.

## Free Geek Mothership

The first Free Geek was established in Portland, OR on Earth Day of some year in the 2000s (2001 maybe).

The Free Geek Mothership website is [[freegeek.org|https://www.freegeek.org]].
