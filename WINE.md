# WINE Is Not an Emulator

[[WINE|http://winehq.org]] is a compatability layer between Unix systems and Windows. It allows some Windows [[binary files|filetypes|#binary]] to run in Unix, and specifically [[Linux]].

## Installing WINE

WINE is availible via the offical repositories and can be installed with [[Apt|Aptitude]] like so:

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install wine

Or also through using the graphical software manager.
