The Root user is the superuser of the computer. Root is identified with the unique [[userID]] of `0`. Root is able to access any file, directory or attribute on the machine permitted by software.

It is dangerous to log in as the root user as then any subsequent program would be run as root and  have unwarranted access to the filesystem. Most users should log in as less privileged users and use `sudo` to administer the computer.

The root user's home folder is usually `/root`

The root user is different than the [[root directory|linux-filesystem#root]]
