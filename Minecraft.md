Minecraft is a fantastic, extensively moddable, voxel stylized world simulator with monsters. Minecraft is sold through [[Minecraft.net|https://minecraft.net/en-us/]], and the `.jar` [[binary file|filetypes#Binary]] can be downloaded there once purchaed.

## Running Minecraft from Official Binary

The Java Archive binary is run via the Java Runtime Environment. To obtain the JRE on a Ubuntu based distribution, you can use the following commands:

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install default-jre default-jdk
```

To run Minecraft after installing the JRE and JDK: `java -jar /path/to/minecraft.jar`. 

The Minecraft launcher is also packaged in some distributions and can be installed using the provided package manager. In Linux Mint (and probably many other Debian based distros), the Minecraft installer can be downloaded from the [[Linux Mint Community page|https://community.linuxmint.com/software/view/minecraft-installer]]. Once downloaded the package can be installed either through right clicking and opening with the `GDebi Package Installer` or using `$ sudo dpkg -i /path/to/minecraft-installer.deb`.
