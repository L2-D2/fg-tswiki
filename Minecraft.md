Minecraft is a fantastic, extensively moddable, voxel stylized world simulator with monsters. Minecraft is sold through [[Minecraft.net|https://minecraft.net/en-us/]], and the `.jar` [[binary file|filetypes#Binary]] can be downloaded there once purchaed.

## Running Minecraft from Official Binary

The Java Archive binary is run via the Java 

`java -jar /path/to/minecraft.jar`




Minecraft ultimately only cares that you log into the authentication server with a valid account, and so the offical `.jar` file will work
