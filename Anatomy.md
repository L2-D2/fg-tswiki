# The Anatomy of a Computer

Computers are made up of many parts; many of which are different for each different type of computer.
Every computer will still have the basic anatomy seen here in some form or another.

## Filesystem Storage (hard drive)

The [[Filesystem]] for the computer must reside somewhere. Some computers keep this data in flash storage and move it into RAM to optimize speed. The typical home computer will have a dedicated piece to store the filesystem for the [[Operating System]].

Hard drives refer to a specific form of storage that holds data on spinning magnetic platters: **h**ard **d**isk **d**rives (HDD). The faster the platters spin, the faster the computer can read or write data.

There are also **s**olid **s**tate **d**rives (SSD) that operate with much faster read/write speeds. These drives have no moving parts and are less prone to corruption by magnetic fields.

## Random Access Memory

The **R**andom **A**ccess **M**emory is the life of the computer. No data can be manipulated before being put into RAM. Anytime you want to do ***anything***, the computer must have the data in RAM before being able to process it onto the screen.without having

This means more RAM gives more space for the computer to process information before having to resort to [[swap space|Partitions#swap-space]]. The faster the RAM -- measured in hertz (Hz), or megahertz (MHz) -- the faster data can move in and out of RAM.

## Power Supply

The **P**ower **S**upply **U**nit provides a stable supply of electricity to the computer.

The back of a PSU may have a few switches. One, labeled `0|1` will turn the power supply on and off. Another with `115|220` alters the expected input voltage. The United States uses a 110V standard and any power supply used as such should be set to `115`

## Mother Board

The Mother Board contains all the central connectors to have all the components talk to each other. Desktop PC motherboards follow the [[Advanced Technology eXtended|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATX]] sizing standard. Laptop motherboards are proprietary to their make and models of cases.

Lets you type things.

### Mouse

Lets you point at and click on things.

### Monitor

Lets you see things.

## Central Processing Unit

The CPU takes data out of ram, performs calculations read from the data about other parts of the data, and pops it back into RAM as altered. A CPU's clock rate -- measured again in Hertz (Hz), but commonly gigahertz (GHz) -- is how frequently, per second, the CPU performs these calculations. A 2 GHz processor can perform 2,000,000,000 of these calculations a second; which is enough to render a [[Minecraft]] world 60 times every second to your monitor.

### CPU Cores

If a CPU is multi-core, then the physical chip slotted into the motherboard actually has multiple processing units that work in tandem. This allows the CPU to perform many more calculations a second and to work with more than one [[process]] at a time.

### CPU Cooling Unit

When the CPU performs these many calculations, it is shifting electricity through tiny conductive pathways embedded in silicon. This rush of electricity causes the CPU chip to heat up. Should the temperature of the CPU get too high, the chip will melt and cease to function.

This is why many CPUs use a large metal brick with fins and/or a fan to wick heat off the CPU and dissipate it into the air.

Proper CPU cooling and air flow management is paramount when running an efficient machine.
